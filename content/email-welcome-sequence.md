## Email 2: Day 3 (Two days after signup)

**Subject:** The one AI trick everyone should know

**Body:**

Hey there!

Quick tip that'll change how you use AI:

**Be specific.**

Instead of this:
❌ "Write me an email"

Try this:
✅ "Write a polite email to my internet provider. I've been overcharged $47 on my February bill. I've been a customer for 12 years. I want a refund and an explanation."

See the difference? More detail = dramatically better results.

**This works for everything:**
- Trip planning → mention your age, interests, budget, mobility
- Recipes → mention dietary needs, skill level, available ingredients  
- Health questions → mention your age, conditions, medications
- Learning → mention what you already know and how you learn best

AI isn't a mind reader. It's a very smart assistant who needs good instructions. The more context you give, the better it performs.

**Try this today:**
Pick one everyday task (writing an email, planning dinner, understanding something confusing) and ask ChatGPT for help. Remember: be specific!

## Email 3: Day 7 (One week after signup)

**Subject:** Is AI safe? (The honest answer)

**Body:**

Hey!

You've been subscribed for a week now. How's it going? Have you tried ChatGPT yet?

One question I get asked more than any other: **"Is AI safe?"**

**The honest answer: Yes, mostly.**

Here's the quick version:

✅ **Safe:**
- Asking questions
- Getting help with writing
- Learning new things
- Planning trips, meals, projects

⚠️ **Be Careful:**
- Don't share bank details, passwords, or Medicare numbers
- Don't trust AI for medical diagnoses (see a doctor)
- Don't trust AI for legal or financial advice (see a professional)
- Watch out for AI-powered scams (voice cloning, fake emails)

❌ **The #1 Rule:**
AI sometimes makes confident mistakes ("hallucinations"). Always verify important information from a trusted source.

**Think of AI like a smart intern.** Fast, helpful, capable — but you still need to check their work.

For the full guide, read: [Is AI Safe? What You Actually Need to Know](https://gd537.github.io/ai-made-simple/articles/ai-safety-what-to-know.html)

**Coming in your inbox next Tuesday:**
Your first full newsletter issue with:
- 📰 The week's biggest AI news (explained simply)
- 🛠️ A step-by-step tutorial you can try
- 🔍 An honest tool review

See you then!

## Notes on Implementation

### Substack Setup:
- Welcome email = Email 1 (auto-sent on subscribe)
- Day 3 and Day 7 emails need scheduled drip (Substack supports this)

### Alternative (if not using Substack):
- SendGrid / Mailchimp for automation
- Can be sent via our Gmail script

### Key Metrics:
- Email 1: Target 80%+ open rate
- Email 2: Target 50%+ open rate  
- Email 3: Target 40%+ open rate
- Each email should drive at least 10% click-through to articles
