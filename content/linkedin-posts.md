## Post 1: Launch Announcement

**AI Made Simple — A New Free Resource**

I've launched something I'm genuinely passionate about.

**AI Made Simple** is a free weekly publication that explains artificial intelligence to people who aren't "tech people."

Here's why:

There are millions of intelligent, curious adults who keep hearing about AI but haven't been given a clear, jargon-free explanation of what it actually is.

Most AI content is made by tech professionals, for tech professionals. It's full of acronyms (LLM, GPT, AGI, RAG, RLHF) and assumes you already know what a "model" or "prompt" is.

That's a problem. Because AI isn't just for engineers and Silicon Valley. It's for:
→ The 67-year-old retiree who wants to understand what her grandkids are talking about
→ The 55-year-old professional whose company just announced an "AI strategy"
→ The 70-year-old who's curious but doesn't know where to start

These people aren't technologically illiterate. They just haven't been taught properly.

**What we publish:**
📰 Weekly AI news (in plain English)
🛠️ Step-by-step tutorials
🔍 Honest tool reviews
🛡️ Safety and privacy guides

Everything is free. No paywalls. No jargon.

If you know someone who'd benefit from this — a parent, colleague, friend, client — please share it with them.

## Post 2: The Market Opportunity

**The biggest underserved market in AI education**

Everyone's building AI tools.
Almost nobody is teaching people how to use them.

Here's a data point that should make every AI company pay attention:

Adults aged 55-75 are the fastest-growing group of AI users — up 340% year-over-year.

Yet the vast majority of AI educational content targets:
- Developers (tutorials, documentation)
- Business leaders (strategy, ROI)
- Students (academic)

Who's being ignored?

The 50+ demographic. A group that:
- Has the most disposable income
- Has the most time to learn
- Has the most practical daily use cases (health, finance, communication)
- Is the most underserved by current AI education

This isn't just a social issue. It's a business opportunity.

The company that cracks "AI education for the mainstream consumer" will build a massive, loyal audience.

That's what we're doing at AI Made Simple. Free, jargon-free AI education for everyone.

What do you think — is there a viable business in teaching "regular people" about AI?

## Post 3: Lesson Learned

**What I learned teaching a 72-year-old to use ChatGPT**

Last month I sat down with my neighbour Pat (72, retired nurse) and showed her ChatGPT.

Within 15 minutes, she had:
✅ Written a complaint letter to her insurance company
✅ Planned a trip to Broome with her sister
✅ Asked about her new blood pressure medication

Her first reaction: "Why didn't anyone show me this sooner?"

**Three things Pat taught me about AI education:**

1. **The barrier isn't intelligence — it's explanation.**
Pat is brilliant. She managed a hospital ward for 20 years. She didn't need a "simpler" AI. She needed a simpler *explanation*.

2. **Practical beats theoretical. Every time.**
Pat didn't ask how transformer architecture works. She asked "can it help me write letters?" Lead with value.

3. **Age bias is the real problem.**
Every time someone assumes an older person "can't learn technology," they're projecting their own bias. Pat learned faster than most 25-year-olds I've seen.

The digital divide isn't about capability. It's about access to clear, respectful education.

That's fixable.

## Post 4: Industry Insight

**Why every company adding AI needs to invest in AI literacy**

Microsoft added Copilot to Office.
Google built Gemini into Gmail.
Apple launched Apple Intelligence.
Salesforce embedded Einstein AI everywhere.

But here's what they're not doing:

Teaching their users HOW to use these features.

The result? Billions spent on AI features that 80%+ of users never touch.

The companies that win won't just build AI. They'll teach AI.

Think about it:
- What good is Copilot in Word if your employee doesn't know how to prompt it?
- What good is Gemini in Gmail if the user doesn't know it exists?
- What good is any AI feature if people are afraid to try it?

**AI literacy is the bottleneck.**

Not model capability. Not compute power. Not data.

The limiting factor is whether humans know how to use what's already available.

This is an opportunity for:
→ L&D teams (corporate AI training)
→ EdTech companies (consumer AI education)
→ Consultants (AI adoption programs)
→ Content creators (AI education media)

The AI literacy market is going to be enormous.

## Post 5: Data Point

**340% increase in AI adoption among over-55s**

Let that number sink in.

The fastest-growing AI user group isn't Gen Z.
It isn't millennials.
It isn't software engineers.

It's adults over 55.

Why? Because AI solves REAL problems they actually have:
→ Writing clear emails and letters
→ Understanding medical information
→ Planning travel and activities
→ Managing household tasks
→ Learning new skills

When you remove the jargon and show people what AI can DO for THEM, adoption is instant.

The lesson for every tech company: Stop marketing AI features. Start teaching AI skills.

The products are ready. The users are ready. The education isn't there yet.

That's the gap we're filling at AI Made Simple.
