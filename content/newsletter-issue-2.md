## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### Apple Intelligence Is Coming to Your iPhone

- It can summarise your notifications
- It can write and rewrite emails/messages
- It can create images from descriptions
- All processing happens ON your phone (better privacy)

**When:** iOS 19.4 expected March-April 2026

**Do you need to do anything?** No. When the update arrives, your phone will offer to turn on AI features. You can try them one at a time.

## 🛠️ This Week's Tutorial: AI Meal Planning

Tired of the "What's for dinner?" question? AI can help. Here's how:

### The Fridge Clean-Out Recipe

Open ChatGPT and type:

> "I have chicken thighs, potatoes, onions, garlic, and olive oil. I want something easy for dinner that takes under 45 minutes. I'm cooking for two."

You'll get a complete recipe — ingredients, steps, cooking times. It's like having a chef friend on call.

### The Weekly Meal Plan

Try this:

> "Create a weekly meal plan for two adults in their 60s. We prefer Mediterranean-style food, eat fish twice a week, and want each meal to cost under $15 to make. Include a shopping list organised by supermarket section."

That last part — "organised by supermarket section" — is the secret. AI will group your list by produce, dairy, meat, pantry staples. No more backtracking through aisles.

### The Dietary Needs Planner

> "I need a week of meals that are low sodium, no red meat, and diabetes-friendly. I live alone and don't want complicated recipes. I have a slow cooker."

AI handles dietary restrictions brilliantly because you can be very specific about YOUR situation.

### Pro Tips:
- **Tell AI your cooking skill level.** "I'm a beginner cook" changes everything.
- **Mention your equipment.** "I only have a stovetop and microwave" prevents suggestions you can't use.
- **Ask for substitutions.** "What can I use instead of cream?" and it'll suggest alternatives.
- **Say "simpler"** if a recipe looks too complex. AI will simplify it.

## 🔍 Tool Review: Google Gemini

**What is it?** Google's AI assistant. Like ChatGPT, but with some Google superpowers.

**Best for:** People who already use Gmail, Google Docs, or have an Android phone.

**Killer feature:** It can see photos! Take a picture of a plant, a dish, a bug, a stain — and ask "What is this?" It usually knows.

**Cost:** Free (basic). $20/month for Advanced.

**How to try it:** Go to gemini.google.com and sign in with your Google account.

**Compared to ChatGPT:** 
- Gemini has more current information (connected to Google)
- ChatGPT is better at long, creative writing
- Both are free and excellent
- Try both and use whichever you prefer

**Our verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ Excellent, especially for Google users.

## 💡 Quick Tip

**Save your best prompts.** When you find a ChatGPT or Gemini prompt that works well, save it in your phone's Notes app. Build your own personal AI toolkit over time. Here's a starter:

- "Explain [topic] in simple terms"
- "Write a polite email about [situation]"  
- "I have [ingredients]. What can I make for dinner?"
- "Summarise this in 3 key points: [paste text]"
- "What questions should I ask my [doctor/mechanic/accountant] about [issue]?"

*P.S. — Try the meal planning trick tonight. I bet you'll be surprised how good the suggestions are. And if they're not? Just say "I don't like that, suggest something else." AI doesn't take it personally.*
