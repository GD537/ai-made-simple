## THREAD 20: "Teaching my family to use AI"

🧵 "I taught 12 family members to use AI. Here's what worked (and what didn't):

1/ WHAT WORKED: One-on-one demos

Sat next to them. Said 'Type this.' Watched them see the result.

10 minutes of hands-on beats hours of explanation.

2/ WHAT WORKED: Starting with their pain points

Not: 'AI can do anything!'
But: 'Remember that insurance letter you complained about? Let's solve it.'

Personal relevance = instant engagement.

3/ WHAT WORKED: Writing prompts for them

I created a note on their phone with 5 prompts they can copy/paste:
• 'Write a polite email about...'
• 'Explain this in simple terms:'
• 'I have these ingredients...'
• 'Help me write a message for...'
• 'What should I ask my doctor about...'

Training wheels work.

4/ WHAT DIDN'T WORK: Sending links

'Check out this YouTube video!' → Never watched.
'Here's a great article!' → Never read.

Text-based explanation = ignored.
Live demonstration = adopted.

5/ WHAT DIDN'T WORK: Explaining how it works

Nobody cared about 'large language models' or 'transformer architecture.'

They wanted to know: 'Can it help me write this thank-you note?'

Utility > theory. Always.

6/ WHAT DIDN'T WORK: Overwhelming with options

'You can use ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, Perplexity...'

Too many choices = paralysis.

'Just use ChatGPT' → instant action.

7/ THE PATTERN:

Simplicity + personal relevance + hands-on demonstration = adoption.

Everything else is noise.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 8)

### Post 53
The most common response I get after teaching someone AI:

'Why didn't I do this sooner?'

Followed by:

'Can it also help me with [completely different thing]?'

The light bulb moment is real. And it's followed by endless curiosity.

### Post 54
Three types of AI users:

1. 'I use it every day for everything' (10%)
2. 'I use it for specific things that save time' (30%)
3. 'I should really try that' (60%)

This newsletter is for turning group 3 into group 2.

You don't need to become group 1. Group 2 is the sweet spot.

### Post 55
Prompt I use when I'm stuck:

'I'm procrastinating on [task] because it feels overwhelming. Help me:
1. Break it into tiny steps
2. Identify the very first action
3. Give me a pep talk'

AI as procrastination buster. Surprisingly effective.

### Post 56
Signs you'd benefit from trying AI:

☑️ You've said 'I'm not good with words'
☑️ You've put off writing an email
☑️ You've felt overwhelmed by choices
☑️ You've wished someone could explain something simply
☑️ You've wanted help planning but didn't want to bother anyone

These are all AI use cases. All free. All waiting.

### Post 57
Most underrated ChatGPT skill:

Saying 'No, try again.'

Don't settle for the first response.
Don't assume AI's first answer is best.
Don't be polite to a machine.

AI has infinite patience for revisions. Use that.

### Post 58
The real AI revolution isn't robots or AGI.

It's millions of everyday people solving everyday problems just a little bit faster.

One email at a time.
One recipe at a time.
One explanation at a time.

Small helps, repeated millions of times.

That's the revolution.
