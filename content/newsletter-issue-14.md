Welcome back! This week we're using AI to take the stress out of planning. Whether it's a milestone birthday, an anniversary dinner, or a family reunion — AI can be your planning assistant.

## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### AI Can Now Help Plan Weddings (And Funerals)

Several AI companies have launched specialized event planning assistants. While they're aimed at professionals, the underlying capability is available to all of us through ChatGPT and Gemini.

**What this means for you:**
The same AI that can help a wedding planner can help you plan a 70th birthday party. The same AI helping funeral directors can help you plan a meaningful memorial. You don't need to pay for specialized tools — general AI is remarkably capable at event planning.

## 🛠️ This Week's Tutorial: AI Event Planning

### Birthday Party Planning

> "Help me plan my husband's 70th birthday party. We're inviting about 30 people (mix of family and old friends). He likes jazz, good food, and hates being the center of attention. Budget is around $2,000. We're in Perth. Give me theme ideas, venue suggestions, and a timeline."

AI creates a comprehensive plan tailored to the guest of honour's personality.

### Anniversary Dinner

> "Plan a special 40th wedding anniversary dinner for my parents. It should be just the immediate family (8 people) at a nice restaurant in Sydney. Mum has dietary restrictions (no gluten). Dad loves Italian food. Budget is $150 per person. Suggest 3 restaurants and what to consider when booking."

### Family Reunion

> "I'm organizing a family reunion for about 40 people, ranging from toddlers to people in their 80s. It's for a Saturday in spring in Melbourne. Help me find a venue type that works for all ages, plan activities everyone can enjoy, and create a timeline for the day."

### Memorial Service Planning

> "I need to plan a memorial service for my mother who passed away. She was 82, loved gardening, was part of a church community, and valued simplicity. We expect about 60 people. Help me plan the service order, suggest readings, and advise on practical arrangements."

AI can help with the practical aspects during difficult times — sensitive, practical guidance when you need it most.

### Holiday Gathering

> "I'm hosting Christmas lunch for 15 people at my home. 3 are vegetarian, 1 is vegan, 2 are gluten-free. Help me plan a menu that has something for everyone without cooking 10 different dishes. Include a prep timeline starting 3 days before."

### Gift Coordination

> "For my parents' 50th anniversary, the family wants to contribute to one big gift instead of individual presents. There are 12 of us (4 adult children with spouses and some grandchildren). Suggest 5 meaningful group gift ideas around $500-1000 total, and explain how to coordinate collection."

## 💡 Quick Tip

**Use AI to write your speech.**

Giving a toast or speech at an event? Try:

> "Help me write a 2-minute speech for my daughter's 21st birthday. She's studying medicine, loves hiking, and has the best sense of humor. I want it to be warm, a little funny, but also meaningful. I'm her father and I'm not usually good at public speaking."

AI creates a draft you can personalize. Practice it a few times, and you'll look like a natural speaker.

## 📧 Reader Question

*"I'm terrible at remembering important dates. Can AI help me stay on top of birthdays and anniversaries?"* — John, 68

John, absolutely! Here are some approaches:

1. **Tell ChatGPT your important dates** and ask it to create reminders: "These are my family birthdays and anniversaries: [list]. Create a calendar reminder list with 2-week advance notice for each."

2. **Use your phone's calendar** — add recurring yearly events with reminders set for 2 weeks before.

3. **Ask AI monthly:** At the start of each month, ask "What occasions typically happen in [month]? Help me remember family events and general gift-giving occasions."

4. **Create a gift idea bank:** "I need to buy gifts for: [list people with ages/interests]. For each person, suggest 3 gift ideas at different price points. Save this so I can refer to it throughout the year."
