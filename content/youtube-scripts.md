## LONG-FORM VIDEO 1 (10-12 minutes)
### "ChatGPT for Complete Beginners — Your First 10 Minutes"

**INTRO (30 sec)**
[Calm, friendly tone]

"If you've been hearing about ChatGPT and feeling like everyone else got the memo except you — this video is for you.

In the next 10 minutes, I'm going to walk you through everything. What it is, how to use it, and five things you can do with it right now. No tech jargon. No assumptions. Just clear, simple guidance.

Let's go."

**SECTION 1: What Is It? (2 min)**

"ChatGPT is a free website where you can have a conversation with an AI — an artificial intelligence.

You type a question or request, and it types back an answer. Like texting a very knowledgeable friend who responds instantly.

It's made by a company called OpenAI. It launched in late 2022 and has been used by over 200 million people. It's not new or experimental — it's well-established and safe to use.

Now, I want to clear up some things ChatGPT is NOT:
- It's not a robot
- It's not alive or conscious
- It's not going to 'take over'
- It doesn't know who you are unless you tell it

It's a tool. Like a calculator or Google. But for conversations, writing, and ideas."

**SECTION 2: Getting Started (3 min)**
[Screen recording]

"Here's exactly how to start. Follow along if you like.

Step 1: Open your web browser — Chrome, Safari, Edge, whatever you use.

Step 2: In the address bar, type: chat.openai.com. Press Enter.

Step 3: You'll see two options: Log in and Sign up. Click Sign up.

Step 4: Enter your email address. Any email works — Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo.

Step 5: Create a password. Make it strong — at least 8 characters with a mix of letters and numbers.

Step 6: Check your email inbox. Click the verification link they send you.

Step 7: You'll see a chat screen with a text box at the bottom. That's where you type.

And that's it. You're in. Took about 60 seconds."

**SECTION 3: Your First Conversation (2 min)**
[Screen recording]

"Let's have your first conversation. Type this:

'Hello! I'm new to this. What can you help me with?'

[Show response]

See? It's friendly and clear. Now let's try something more useful.

'Write a polite email to my electricity company asking why my bill doubled this month. I've been a customer for 10 years.'

[Show response]

Look at that. A well-written, professional email in about 5 seconds. You can edit it, add details, then copy and paste it into your email.

One more. Let's say you're planning dinner:

'I have chicken, potatoes, and broccoli. Suggest a simple dinner recipe.'

[Show response]

It even includes cooking times and temperatures. This is the everyday power of AI."

**SECTION 4: Five Things to Try (3 min)**

"Here are five things I'd recommend trying this week:

Number 1: Write an email you've been putting off. Whether it's a complaint, a thank-you note, or a difficult conversation — AI drafts it in seconds.

Number 2: Plan your next meal. Tell it what's in your fridge and your dietary preferences.

Number 3: Explain something confusing. Got a medical report? Insurance document? Legal letter? Paste it in and say 'Explain this in simple English.'

Number 4: Plan a trip. Tell it where you want to go, your budget, how long, and what you enjoy.

Number 5: Learn something new. Ask it to explain any topic — history, science, technology, gardening — at your level."

**SECTION 5: Safety Tips (1 min)**

"Three important safety tips:

One: Don't share sensitive personal information. No bank details, passwords, Medicare numbers, or personal identification numbers.

Two: Don't trust it blindly. AI occasionally makes mistakes — especially with specific facts, dates, or current events. Always double-check important information.

Three: It's not a doctor, lawyer, or financial adviser. It can help you understand these topics, but for personal decisions, always consult a qualified professional.

With those three rules, you're completely safe."

**OUTRO (30 sec)**

"And that's it. You now know more about ChatGPT than most people.

The only thing left is to try it. Go to chat.openai.com. Create your free account. Ask it something.

If this video helped, please subscribe. I make one of these every week — all explaining AI in plain, simple language.

I'm Sam, and this is AI Made Simple. See you next time."

## SHORTS (60 seconds each)

### Short 4: "Google Gemini vs ChatGPT in 60 Seconds"

"ChatGPT or Google Gemini? Which should you use?

ChatGPT is better at: Writing, creative tasks, long conversations, and following complex instructions.

Google Gemini is better at: Current information, integration with Gmail and Google Docs, and analysing images.

Both are free. Both are excellent. Both work the same way — you type, AI responds.

My recommendation? Try both. Use whichever feels more natural.

ChatGPT: chat.openai.com
Gemini: gemini.google.com

Follow for more AI tips — explained simply."

### Short 5: "The 3 Rules of Using AI Safely"

"Three rules. That's all you need to use AI safely.

Rule one: Don't share sensitive information. No bank details. No passwords. No Medicare numbers. Treat AI like a public conversation.

Rule two: Don't trust it completely. AI sometimes makes confident mistakes. Always double-check important facts.

Rule three: It's not a replacement for professionals. Use AI to prepare for your doctor, lawyer, or financial adviser — not to replace them.

Follow these three rules and you'll be completely fine.

AI Made Simple. No jargon. No hype."

### Short 6: "Ask AI This Before Your Next Doctor's Visit"

"Going to the doctor? Try this first.

Open ChatGPT and type:
'I'm seeing my doctor about [your concern]. I'm [your age]. What questions should I ask to get the most out of my appointment?'

You'll get a list of smart, specific questions you might not have thought of.

This doesn't replace your doctor. It makes you a better patient.

Write down the questions. Take them with you. Your doctor will be impressed.

AI Made Simple — practical AI tips every week."

### Short 7: "One Prompt That Fixes Bad AI Answers"

"Getting confusing answers from ChatGPT? Say this:

'Explain that again, but like you're talking to someone who has never heard of this topic. Use everyday language and real-world examples.'

That's it. One sentence transforms AI from confusing to crystal clear.

Works every time. With any topic.

Save this for later. You'll need it.

AI Made Simple."

### Short 8: "AI Can Read Your Photos Now"

"Your phone can identify ANYTHING through your camera. Here's how:

On Android: Open your camera. Tap the Google Lens icon.
On iPhone: Open the Google app. Tap the camera icon.

Now point at:
- A plant → It tells you the species
- A building → It gives you history
- Foreign text → It translates instantly
- A product → It finds where to buy it

This is Google Lens. It's free. It's AI. And it's already on your phone.

AI Made Simple."
