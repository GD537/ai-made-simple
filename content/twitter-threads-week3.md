## THREAD 6: AI for your health (carefully)

🧵 "How to use AI for health questions WITHOUT putting yourself at risk. A thread:

1/ First, the golden rule: AI IS NOT A DOCTOR.

Don't ask it to diagnose you. Don't change medication based on its advice. Don't skip a doctor's visit because AI said you're fine.

Now — here's where AI IS incredibly helpful for health:

2/ ✅ PREPARING FOR APPOINTMENTS

Try: 'I'm seeing my doctor about persistent lower back pain. I'm 65. What questions should I ask to get the most out of my 15-minute appointment?'

You'll walk in prepared. Your doctor will be impressed.

3/ ✅ UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL JARGON

Got a test result that says 'mild bilateral osteoarthritis with moderate degenerative changes'?

Ask AI: 'Explain this in simple English.'

Translation: 'You have typical age-related wear and tear in both joints. Common and manageable.'

4/ ✅ UNDERSTANDING MEDICATIONS

'I've been prescribed Metformin 500mg. In simple terms: what does it do, what are common side effects, and what should I avoid while taking it?'

Always verify with your pharmacist — but this gives you a head start.

5/ ✅ EXERCISE PLANNING

'Create a gentle exercise plan for a 68-year-old with mild knee arthritis. I can walk but not jog. I have no equipment. 30 minutes max, 4 times a week.'

AI designs a plan tailored to YOUR situation.

6/ ✅ NUTRITION

'I have Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Create 5 easy dinner recipes that are good for both conditions. I cook for one.'

Specific, practical, personalised meal help.

7/ ❌ NEVER use AI for:
- Emergency symptoms (chest pain? CALL 000)
- Diagnosing yourself ('I have these symptoms, what is it?')
- Deciding to stop medication
- Replacing professional medical advice

AI is a PREPARATION tool, not a TREATMENT tool.

8/ THE SMART FORMULA:

BEFORE appointment → Use AI to prepare questions
DURING appointment → Focus on your doctor
AFTER appointment → Use AI to understand what they said

This makes you a more informed, more empowered patient.

## THREAD 7: AI myths older adults believe (and shouldn't)

🧵 "7 AI myths I hear from people over 50 (and the truth):

1/ MYTH: 'AI is too complicated for me'
TRUTH: If you can send a text message, you can use AI. It's a text box. You type. It responds. That's it.

2/ MYTH: 'AI will steal my personal information'
TRUTH: Major AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Gemini) are as secure as your email. Don't share passwords or bank details and you're fine.

3/ MYTH: 'AI is only for young tech people'
TRUTH: Adults 55-75 are the FASTEST growing group of AI users. Because they have real problems AI actually helps with.

4/ MYTH: 'If I say something wrong, I'll break it'
TRUTH: You literally cannot break ChatGPT. Say anything. It will respond. If the answer is bad, just say 'try again.'

5/ MYTH: 'AI is always right'
TRUTH: AI makes confident mistakes. It's a great starting point, not the final word. Always verify important information.

6/ MYTH: 'AI will replace human connection'
TRUTH: AI is a TOOL, not a companion. It helps you DO things better. It doesn't replace family, friends, or professionals.

7/ MYTH: 'It's too late to learn this stuff'
TRUTH: It takes 5 minutes to start. There's no 'catching up' — AI is new for EVERYONE. You're not behind.

The only mistake? Not trying.

## THREAD 8: Real stories from real seniors using AI

🧵 "Real stories from people over 60 who started using AI this year:

1/ Margaret, 71 (retired teacher):
'I use ChatGPT to help me write emails. I know what I want to say but can never get the words right. Now I tell it the situation and it writes a perfect draft. I just tweak it to sound like me.'

2/ David, 67 (retired engineer):
'I asked it to explain my medical test results. My doctor didn't have time. ChatGPT spent 20 minutes explaining every line in plain English. I finally understood.'

3/ Patricia, 73 (grandmother):
'My grandchildren live overseas. I use Google Translate powered by AI to write messages in French to my grandson in Paris. He writes back and AI translates it for me.'

4/ Robert, 69 (hobby gardener):
'I take photos of bugs and diseases on my plants and show them to Google Lens. It identifies them and tells me how to treat the problem. Saved my tomatoes this summer.'

5/ Janet, 75 (widow):
'Living alone, I sometimes use ChatGPT just to work through decisions. Not for advice — but to think out loud. It asks good follow-up questions that help me clarify my own thinking.'

6/ Brian, 64 (small business):
'I run a small gardening business. AI writes my invoices, marketing emails, and even my Google Business profile. Saves me hours every week.'

Every one of these people started with one simple question.

Your turn.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 3)

### Post 21
Here's something nobody tells you about AI:

The QUALITY of your question determines the quality of the answer.

Bad: "Help me"
Good: "Help me write a polite but firm email to my electricity company about a $47 overcharge on my February bill. I've been a customer for 12 years."

One sentence of context = dramatically better results.

### Post 22
Fact: There are more adults over 55 using ChatGPT today than there were TOTAL users in January 2023.

AI adoption among seniors isn't slow. It's accelerating.

The difference? Someone showed them it was useful. Not scary. Not complicated. Useful.

That's what we do at @AIMadeSimple.

### Post 23
If you could ask AI ONE question right now, what would it be?

Drop it below. I'll answer it in plain English. 👇

No question is too basic. No question is too silly. The only silly thing is not asking.

### Post 24
🧓 Things I hear from over-60s after they try AI for the first time:

"Why didn't anyone show me this sooner?"
"This would have saved me hours"
"Can I use this for [literally everything]?"
"I feel like I have a superpower"

Nobody ever says "That was too hard."

### Post 25
PSA for adult children:

Instead of sighing when your parents ask tech questions, try this:

1. Open ChatGPT for them
2. Show them ONE thing it can do that matters to THEM
3. Walk away

They'll figure out the rest. They figured out ATMs, mobile phones, and the internet. They'll figure out AI.

Give them the spark. They'll build the fire.
