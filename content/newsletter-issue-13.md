Welcome back! This week we're getting practical around the house. Whether you're troubleshooting appliances, planning renovations, or just trying to understand what that mysterious switch does — AI can help.

## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### Google's AI Can Now Control Your Smart Home

Google announced that Gemini can now directly control smart home devices — not just through voice commands, but through conversational AI.

**What's new:**
Instead of "Hey Google, turn on the living room lights," you can now say:
- "Make the house feel cozy for movie night"
- "We're going to bed — prepare the house"
- "I'm having guests over for dinner — set up the dining room"

Gemini interprets what you actually want and adjusts multiple devices together.

**Should you care?**
If you already have smart home devices (Google Home, Nest, smart lights), this makes them more intuitive. If you don't, this isn't a reason to start — but it shows where home technology is heading.

## 🛠️ This Week's Tutorial: AI for Home Projects

### Appliance Troubleshooting

Before you call a repairman (or your handy nephew), try this:

> "My washing machine is making a grinding noise during the spin cycle. It's a Samsung WA50R5400AW, about 4 years old. What might be causing this, and what can I check myself before calling a technician?"

AI often identifies common issues and safe DIY checks — potentially saving you a $150 callout fee.

### Understanding Your Home

Moved into a new house? Found a mysterious switch or valve?

> "I found a valve in my garage with a red handle near the ceiling. The house is a 1980s Australian brick home. What is this likely to be, and should I ever touch it?"

(Pro tip: It's probably a gas shut-off valve, and the answer is 'only in emergencies.')

### Planning Renovations

Before you call a contractor:

> "I want to convert my single garage into a home office in Perth, Western Australia. What council approvals might I need? What are the typical cost ranges? What should I think about before starting?"

AI gives you a research foundation so you can have informed conversations with professionals.

### Garden Planning

> "I have a 4m x 6m garden bed in Perth that gets morning sun but afternoon shade. I want low-maintenance Australian native plants that attract birds. What should I plant, and in what arrangement?"

AI creates a personalised planting plan tailored to your specific conditions.

### Paint Colour Selection

> "I'm painting my open-plan living/dining room. The kitchen cabinets are white, floors are grey timber-look tiles, and the sofa is navy blue. Suggest 5 wall paint colours that would work, explaining why each would complement the existing elements."

No more overwhelm at the paint store.

### DIY Project Planning

> "I want to build a simple raised garden bed. I have basic tools (saw, drill, hammer) but I'm not an experienced woodworker. Give me a simple design, materials list, and step-by-step instructions for a 1.2m x 0.6m bed."

AI creates beginner-friendly project plans.

## 🔍 Tool Review: Google Lens for Home Projects

**What is it?** The visual search tool on your phone — but specifically useful for home projects.

**Home project uses:**
- **Identify plants** — Point at a weed or unknown plant to identify it
- **Find products** — Point at a tap, fixture, or part to find where to buy replacements
- **Read model numbers** — Photograph hard-to-read labels on appliances
- **Measure things** — Some phones can use AR to measure rooms and objects
- **Identify pests** — Point at that bug in your garden to know if it's friend or foe

**Our verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Essential for home projects. It's free and already on your phone.

## 💡 Quick Tip

**Create a "Home Maintenance AI Log"**

Start a note on your phone or computer. Every time you ask AI about your home, save the question and answer:

- "September 2026: Asked about aircon filter cleaning — needs doing every 3 months"
- "October 2026: Asked about that garage valve — it's the gas shut-off"

Over time, you build a personalised home manual that you created through conversations with AI.
