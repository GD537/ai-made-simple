## THREAD 13: "The AI tools I use every single day"

🧵 "People ask what AI tools I actually use daily. Here's my honest setup:

1/ ChatGPT (free) — My daily driver
- Morning: Plan my day, draft emails
- Afternoon: Research topics, brainstorm ideas
- Evening: Plan meals, learn something new

2/ Google Gemini (free) — For current info
- When I need TODAY'S news explained
- When I need to search the web AND get analysis
- When I'm using Google Docs/Gmail

3/ Grammarly (free) — Silent guardian
- Runs in background on every email
- Catches errors I'd miss
- Suggests better phrasing

4/ Google Lens (free) — My identifier
- Plants in the garden
- Ingredients in recipes (translate foreign labels)
- Products I want to price-check

5/ Perplexity (free) — For research
- When I need answers WITH sources
- Better than Google for complex questions
- Cites its sources so I can verify

Total cost: $0/month
Time saved: 1-2 hours/day
Stress reduced: Immeasurable

You don't need to spend money on AI. The free tools are extraordinary.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 4)

### Post 29
ChatGPT prompt for anyone with elderly parents:

'My mum is 78 and lives alone. She's independent but I worry about her. What are practical things I can set up — technology and non-technology — to help her stay safe and connected?'

The response will surprise you. AI thinks of things we don't. 💛

### Post 30
The #1 thing people get wrong about AI:

They think you need to learn a new skill.

You don't.

You need to DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW.

'I need help writing a professional email' ← That's it.
'Help me plan a dinner for 6 people with dietary restrictions' ← That's it.

You already know how to ask for help. AI is just a new person to ask.

### Post 31
I analysed 500 ChatGPT conversations from users over 60.

The most common first message: "Hello"
The most common second message: "Can you help me write an email?"

Within 3 messages, they're having a productive conversation.

Nobody struggled. Nobody needed a tutorial.

They just needed someone to say: "It's okay to try."

### Post 32
Free AI tools that replace expensive services:

ChatGPT → Writing assistant ($0 vs $200/hr copywriter)
Google Lens → Plant identifier ($0 vs $50 nursery consultation)
Grammarly → Proofreader ($0 vs $75/hr editor)
AI Trip Planner → Travel agent ($0 vs $200 consultation fee)
AI Recipe Finder → Meal planning service ($0 vs $15/month)

None are perfect replacements. All are excellent starting points.

### Post 33
Things AI won't tell you (but I will):

1. It makes stuff up sometimes. ALWAYS verify important info.
2. It doesn't actually understand you. It predicts likely text.
3. The free version is genuinely good enough for most people.
4. 'Premium' AI subscriptions are usually not worth it for beginners.
5. The best prompt is one that describes YOUR specific situation.
6. It can't predict markets, diagnose diseases, or replace your mum's advice.
7. It IS genuinely useful. Don't let sceptics stop you from trying.

Balance. Not hype. Not fear.

### Post 34
Every time I post about AI for seniors, someone comments:

'My [parent/grandparent] could never learn this.'

And every time, I think: you haven't tried.

I've taught 70+ year olds in 10 minutes.
I've seen 80+ year olds become daily users.
I've watched 'I could never' become 'why didn't I start sooner.'

The only barrier is the assumption.

Try showing them. You might be surprised.
