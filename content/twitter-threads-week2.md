## THREAD 3: AI Scams to Watch Out For

🧵 "AI scams are getting SCARY good. Here are 5 scams targeting older adults right now — and how to protect yourself:

1/ 🎙️ VOICE CLONING SCAMS
Scammers can now clone a family member's voice from just 3 seconds of audio.
They call saying 'Grandma, I'm in trouble, I need money.'
It SOUNDS like your grandchild. It's not.

PROTECT: Hang up. Call the real person directly. Create a family code word.

2/ 📧 AI-WRITTEN PHISHING EMAILS
Old phishing emails had spelling mistakes. AI-written ones are PERFECT.
They look exactly like real emails from your bank, Medicare, or Amazon.

PROTECT: Never click links in emails. Go directly to the website by typing the address yourself.

3/ 🖼️ DEEPFAKE VIDEOS
AI can create realistic videos of people saying things they never said.
Used for romance scams, fake investment advice, fake celebrity endorsements.

PROTECT: If a video celebrity is telling you to invest money — it's fake. Always verify.

4/ 💬 FAKE CUSTOMER SERVICE CHATBOTS
Scammers create fake AI chatbots that pretend to be Amazon, banks, or tech support.
They ask for your password, card number, or remote access.

PROTECT: Never give passwords to a chatbot. Real companies don't ask this way.

5/ 📱 FAKE AI APPS
App stores have thousands of fake 'AI' apps that charge hidden subscriptions.
Some charge $50-100/week for features that are free elsewhere.

PROTECT: Only use recommended apps. Check reviews. Watch for subscription traps.

THE GOLDEN RULE: If someone (or something) is rushing you to act NOW — stop. Scammers create urgency. Real companies don't.

Save this thread. Share it with someone you love.

## THREAD 4: What AI can't do (and why that matters)

🧵 "Everyone talks about what AI CAN do. Let's talk about what it CAN'T.

1/ AI can't feel emotions.
It can recognise emotion in text. It can generate emotional text.
But it doesn't feel joy, sadness, or empathy.
When ChatGPT says 'I'm sorry you're going through that' — it's pattern matching, not compassion.

2/ AI can't guarantee truth.
It predicts likely text based on patterns. Sometimes those patterns lead to confident, well-written nonsense.
This is called 'hallucination.' It's the #1 thing to remember.
Always verify important information.

3/ AI can't understand your personal context.
It doesn't know your medical history. Your family dynamics. Your financial situation.
It gives GENERAL advice based on patterns.
For PERSONAL decisions — talk to real humans who know you.

4/ AI can't replace human connection.
It can simulate conversation. It can be comforting.
But it's not a friend, therapist, or partner.
Use it as a TOOL, not a relationship.

5/ AI can't predict the future.
Despite what crypto bros tell you, AI can't reliably predict stock markets, elections, or sports outcomes.
Anyone selling AI 'predictions' is selling snake oil.

6/ AI can't be creative (truly).
It remixes existing patterns brilliantly.
But genuine creativity — the kind that changes the world — comes from human experience, emotion, and intuition.
AI is a powerful TOOL for creative people. Not a replacement for them.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Understanding AI's limits makes you a BETTER user of AI.
You'll know when to trust it. When to verify it. When to ignore it.

That's wisdom. And no AI can teach you that.

## THREAD 5: Setting up ChatGPT (visual walkthrough)

🧵 "Never used ChatGPT? Here's a complete walkthrough — every step, no assumptions.

1/ Open your web browser. 
Chrome, Safari, Firefox — whatever you normally use.
Type this address: chat.openai.com
Press Enter.

2/ Click 'Sign up' (not 'Log in' — that's for people who already have an account).

3/ Enter your email address.
Use whatever email you already have — Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, anything works.
Create a password (make it strong — mix of letters, numbers, symbols).

4/ Check your email for a verification link.
Click it. This proves you're a real person.

5/ You'll see a chat screen.
There's a text box at the bottom — like a text message.
That's where you type your question.

6/ Try your first message:
'Hello! I'm new here. Can you explain what you can help me with?'
Press Enter (or click the send button).

7/ Read the response!
ChatGPT will introduce itself and list things it can help with.
The conversation continues — just keep typing.

8/ Some ideas for your next messages:
'Write me a polite email declining a dinner invitation'
'Explain inflation like I'm 10 years old'
'What are 5 easy dinner recipes using chicken?'

9/ TIPS:
→ Be specific (more detail = better answers)
→ Say 'simpler please' if the answer is too complex
→ Say 'try again' if you don't like the response
→ You can start a new conversation anytime (click '+ New chat')

10/ That's it. You're using AI.

No degree required. No technical knowledge needed. Just curiosity.

Welcome to the future. It's friendlier than you thought.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 2)

### Post 16 (Engagement)
The moment my mum realised AI was useful:

She was on hold with the insurance company for 45 minutes.

I said: 'Ask ChatGPT to write a clear complaint email instead.'

5 minutes later, she had a perfectly written email.

She got a response within 24 hours.

She hasn't called a helpline since.

### Post 17 (Educational)
People ask: "Should I be afraid of AI?"

Here's my honest answer:

Be afraid of people who USE AI badly.
Don't be afraid of the tool itself.

A knife can cook dinner or cause harm.
AI can educate or deceive.

The tool doesn't decide. We do.

Learn it. Use it wisely.

### Post 18 (Practical)
Most useful ChatGPT prompt I've found for over-50s:

"I'm [age] years old. I'm not tech-savvy. Explain [topic] to me using everyday language, real-world examples, and no abbreviations."

This one prompt transforms AI from confusing to crystal clear.

Try it with ANYTHING. Tax. Health. Technology. History.

---

### Post 19 (Data Point)
Interesting stat:

Adults aged 55-75 are the FASTEST growing group of AI users.

Not because they're being forced.

Because they're discovering it's genuinely useful for:
→ Health questions
→ Travel planning
→ Writing help
→ Learning new things
→ Staying connected

The 'AI is for young people' myth needs to die.
