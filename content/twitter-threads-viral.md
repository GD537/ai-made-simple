## THREAD 9: "AI vs Actual Scams" (Newsworthy)

🧵 "⚠️ ALERT: The 5 AI scams targeting Australians RIGHT NOW

I'm seeing more and more people fall for these. Please read and share.

1/ THE GRANDPARENT SCAM (Voice Cloning)

Scammers clone a family member's voice from social media posts.
They call pretending to be your grandchild: 'Nan, I've been arrested, I need $5,000 bail money. Don't tell Mum.'

It SOUNDS real. It's not.

DEFENCE: Hang up. Call the real person on their usual number. Create a family code word only you know.

2/ THE CELEBRITY INVESTMENT

You see a video of Elon Musk / Mark Zuckerberg / a famous Australian endorsing an investment platform with 'guaranteed 30% returns.'

The video is AI-generated. The platform is fake. Your money is gone.

DEFENCE: No real investment guarantees returns. Check ASIC's register. Never invest based on social media ads.

3/ THE PERFECT PHISHING EMAIL

Old scam emails had spelling mistakes. AI-written ones are flawless.
'Your Commonwealth Bank account has been compromised...'
Complete with your name, perfect branding, and a convincing URL.

DEFENCE: Never click email links. Open your browser and go to your bank's website directly.

4/ THE AI GIRLFRIEND/BOYFRIEND

Romance scammers now use AI to maintain conversations 24/7.
They build emotional connections over weeks, then ask for money.
They never have video calls (or use deepfake video).

DEFENCE: If someone online asks for money before meeting in person — it's a scam. Always.

5/ THE FAKE AI APP

App stores have hundreds of fake 'AI' apps charging $50-100/WEEK.
They offer features you can get free from ChatGPT.
Many download malware or steal data.

DEFENCE: Only use: chat.openai.com (ChatGPT), gemini.google.com (Google), copilot.microsoft.com (Microsoft). That's it.

Share this thread. Someone you know needs to see it.

## THREAD 10: "What I wish someone told my parents" (Emotional/Shareable)

🧵 "What I wish someone had told my parents about AI before they heard about it from the news:

1/ It's not the Terminator.
The AI in movies is fiction. Real AI is a text tool that helps you write emails and plan dinners. That's it. It's closer to a calculator than a robot.

2/ You won't break it.
You can't accidentally delete the internet or hack yourself by using ChatGPT. It's a website. Like Google. Type something, get an answer.

3/ It's not 'too late' to learn.
AI is new for EVERYONE. A 25-year-old started learning it 2 years ago. You're starting now. The gap is nothing. And you have something they don't: life experience that makes you ask better questions.

4/ Your questions aren't stupid.
'Can AI help me write a letter to my doctor?'
'Can it help me understand my electricity bill?'
'Can it plan a trip for two people with bad knees?'

These aren't stupid questions. They're EXACTLY what AI is for.

5/ Nobody is laughing at you.
The tech world desperately WANTS older adults to use AI. You're the fastest growing user group. Companies are designing features specifically for you.

6/ You already use AI.
If you've used:
→ Phone autocomplete? AI.
→ Netflix recommendations? AI.
→ Google Maps traffic? AI.
→ Photo search on your phone? AI.

You've been using AI for years.

7/ The only mistake is not trying.
Go to chat.openai.com
Type: 'I'm [age] and I've never used AI. What should I know?'
Read the answer.

That's all it takes.

If this resonates, share it with someone who needs to hear it. ❤️

## THREAD 11: "Controversial take" (Engagement Bait — Genuine)

🧵 "Controversial take: Ageism in tech is the biggest barrier to AI adoption.

Not cost. Not complexity. Not access.

Ageism.

Here's what I mean:

1/ When a 30-year-old doesn't understand AI, we say 'they need training.'
When a 65-year-old doesn't understand AI, we say 'they can't learn technology.'

Same situation. Different assumption.

2/ AI companies design onboarding for 25-year-olds.
Tiny text. Jargon-heavy. Assumes you know what 'prompting' means.
Then they wonder why adoption among 50+ is 'slow.'
It's not slow. Your onboarding is exclusionary.

3/ Media portrays AI as either:
a) A threat to destroy humanity
b) A tool for tech geniuses

Neither helps a 68-year-old understand it can help them write a letter.

4/ Adult children dismiss their parents' ability to learn.
'Oh, my mum would never understand ChatGPT.'
Have you tried showing her? In 15 minutes?
Because I have. And she learned faster than most of your colleagues.

5/ The result: a generation with MORE time, MORE money, and MORE practical need for AI... being left behind because of assumptions about their capability.

6/ The fix is simple:
→ Explain AI in plain language (not jargon)
→ Show practical value (not tech demos)
→ Respect intelligence (they ran businesses, raised families, built careers)
→ Meet people where they are

That's what @AIMadeSimple does.

No jargon. No condescension. Just clear, helpful guides.

Because the AI divide isn't about age. It's about explanation."

## STANDALONE VIRAL POSTS

### Post 26 (Shareable stat)
Mind-blowing stat:

The average 65-year-old asks BETTER questions to ChatGPT than the average 25-year-old.

Why? Life experience.

They ask specific, context-rich questions.
Not "write me something cool" but "write a firm but polite email to my insurance company about the claim they denied for my roof repair on January 15th."

Specificity is the #1 skill in AI. And it comes from experience.

### Post 27 (Emotional)
My favourite ChatGPT use case ever:

An 80-year-old woman used it to write letters to each of her 7 grandchildren, capturing memories and life lessons she wanted them to have.

She knew what she wanted to say. She just needed help finding the words.

AI didn't write those letters. She did. AI just helped her get the words out of her heart and onto paper.

That's technology at its best.

### Post 28 (Practical + Viral)
The most underrated AI use case:

Translating doctor-speak into human.

Next time you leave a medical appointment confused, type this into ChatGPT:

"My doctor said I have [condition] and prescribed [medication]. Explain what this means, what the medication does, and what questions I should ask at my next appointment. I'm [age]."

Life-changing for patient understanding.

(Not a replacement for your doctor. A complement to them.)
