## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### Google Just Made Its Best AI Free for Everyone

Google released Gemini 2.5 this week — their most advanced AI model yet. And unlike some competitors, it's completely free to use.

**What this means for you:** You now have access to AI that can:
- Answer complex questions with current information
- Analyse images (take a photo and ask "what is this?")
- Help with writing, planning, and problem-solving
- Work inside Gmail, Docs, and Sheets

**Try it:** Go to gemini.google.com and sign in with your Google account. That's it.

## 🛠️ This Week's Tutorial: Your First ChatGPT Conversation

Never used ChatGPT? Here's a 5-minute guide:

**Step 1:** Open your web browser (Chrome, Safari, whatever you use)

**Step 2:** Go to chat.openai.com

**Step 3:** Click "Sign up" and create a free account (you can use your email or Google account)

**Step 4:** You'll see a text box. Type something! Here are three great first messages:

> "I'm new to AI. Can you explain what you are in simple terms?"

> "Help me write a thank-you note to my neighbour who looked after my cat last week."

> "I'm planning a weekend trip to [your city]. What should I see and do?"

**Step 5:** Read the response. If you want more detail, just ask! Say "Can you explain that more simply?" or "Give me more options."

**That's it.** You're now using AI. Congratulations!

**Pro tip:** Be specific. Instead of "Write me a letter," try "Write a polite letter to my insurance company explaining that my claim for the roof damage from the January storm hasn't been processed after 3 weeks."

## 🔍 Tool Review: ChatGPT

**What is it?** A free AI chatbot you can talk to about almost anything.

**Best for:** Writing help, answering questions, brainstorming, learning new things.

**Cost:** Free (basic version). $20/month for Plus (faster, smarter).

**Difficulty:** Easy — if you can send a text message, you can use ChatGPT.

**Our verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Essential. Everyone should try it at least once.

**One thing to know:** ChatGPT sometimes makes things up (called "hallucinations"). Always double-check important facts — especially medical, legal, or financial information.

## 💡 Quick Tip

**The magic phrase:** Start any ChatGPT message with "Explain like I'm a complete beginner" and watch the response transform from technical jargon to clear, simple language.
