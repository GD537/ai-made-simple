## THREAD 16: "AI mistakes to avoid"

🧵 "6 common AI mistakes I see people make (and how to fix them):

1/ BEING TOO VAGUE

❌ 'Write me an email'
✅ 'Write a professional email to my bank disputing a $47 fee on my account. I've been a customer for 15 years.'

Specificity = quality.

2/ ACCEPTING THE FIRST RESPONSE

AI's first answer is often good but not great.

Say: 'That's close, but make it shorter' or 'Try a different approach' or 'Make it sound more like me.'

AI has infinite patience for revisions.

3/ ASKING FOR MEDICAL/LEGAL/FINANCIAL ADVICE

AI can EXPLAIN these topics but shouldn't ADVISE you on personal decisions.

✅ 'Explain what this test result means'
❌ 'Should I have this surgery?'

Always consult professionals for personal decisions.

4/ SHARING SENSITIVE INFORMATION

Never share:
• Passwords
• Bank account numbers
• Medicare numbers
• Personal ID numbers

AI doesn't need this info to help you. And you can't unshare it.

5/ TRUSTING AI COMPLETELY

AI makes confident mistakes. It's called 'hallucination.'

Always verify important facts — especially dates, specific figures, and current information.

AI is brilliant for drafts. But you're the fact-checker.

6/ THINKING IT'S TOO HARD

The biggest mistake: not trying.

If you're reading this thread, you can use AI. It's typing and reading. That's all.

## THREAD 17: "AI changed my relationship with technology"

🧵 "Personal confession: I used to be afraid of technology. Here's what changed:

1/ I grew up with rotary phones and typewriters. Computers always felt like something 'other people' understood. I learned to use what I had to, avoided everything else.

2/ Then ChatGPT happened. Someone showed me. I typed a question. I got an answer. No manual. No confusing interface. Just... a conversation.

3/ What changed: I realised technology had finally caught up to how humans naturally communicate. We TALK. We ASK. We CONVERSE.

AI doesn't require you to learn its language. It speaks yours.

4/ The first useful thing I did: asked it to explain my phone settings. 'I have an iPhone 14. Walk me through the accessibility settings step by step. I want larger text and fewer notifications.'

It did. No judgement. No 'you should know this.' Just help.

5/ Then emails became easy. 'Write a thank-you note to my son's teacher.' 'Draft a complaint to my insurance company.' 'Help me say happy birthday to my sister who lost her husband last year.'

AI found words when I couldn't.

6/ The fear is gone now. Not because I understand technology better — but because technology finally understands ME.

You type. It helps. That's it.

7/ To everyone who feels like tech is 'not for people like me':

It is now. It really is.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 6)

### Post 41
I've been asked to summarise AI in one sentence.

Here it is:

'A tool that turns your questions into useful answers, your rough ideas into polished drafts, and your confusion into clarity — for free, instantly, 24/7.'

That's it. That's AI.

### Post 42
ChatGPT prompt I use weekly:

'I'm feeling overwhelmed about [situation]. Help me break this down into small, manageable steps. What should I do first?'

AI as a thought organiser. Underrated use case.

### Post 43
The generation that said 'computers will never catch on' learned to use computers.

The generation that said 'email is a fad' learned to use email.

The generation that said 'smartphones are complicated' learned to use smartphones.

They'll learn AI too. They just need time.

### Post 44
Conversation with my dad (72):

'What if I say something stupid to it?'
'It doesn't judge you.'
'What if I break it?'
'You can't.'
'What if someone sees what I typed?'
'Only you.'

He started using it that day. Most barriers are imagined.

### Post 45
Unpopular opinion:

AI won't replace creativity. It will reveal who was creative all along.

People with good ideas but no technical skills? Now they can build.
People with stories but not words? Now they can write.
People with vision but no design skills? Now they can create.

AI is an amplifier.

### Post 46
The most heartwarming AI use case I've heard:

A 75-year-old woman uses ChatGPT to write daily journal entries. She speaks her memories aloud, types the summaries, and asks AI to help structure them into stories.

She's writing her memoirs for her grandchildren.

AI as legacy preservation. Beautiful.
