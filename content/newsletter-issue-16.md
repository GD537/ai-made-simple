## "AI Ethics: When Should We NOT Use AI?"
### By Sam Digital · May 2026

Welcome back! We've spent months learning what AI CAN do. Today, let's talk about what it SHOULDN'T do — and when we should consciously choose human alternatives.

## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### First AI Ethics Case Reaches Australian Courts

An interesting legal case is developing in Melbourne: a company used AI to make redundancy decisions during layoffs, and affected employees are claiming the process was unfair.

**The key question:** Is it ethical to let AI make decisions that significantly impact people's lives?

**The arguments:**
- Company: "AI removed human bias from the process"
- Employees: "AI can't understand individual circumstances"

**What this tells us:** AI ethics aren't theoretical anymore. They're playing out in real workplaces and courtrooms.

## 🛠️ When NOT to Use AI

### ❌ When Human Connection Matters

**Writing a sympathy card to a close friend:**

AI can help with the words, but sometimes writing imperfectly — with your own awkward but genuine effort — matters more than perfectly crafted phrases.

**Celebrating milestones:**

Your child doesn't want ChatGPT's birthday toast. They want YOUR words, YOUR memories, YOUR love — even if you stumble.

**In arguments and conflicts:**

AI can draft calm responses. But some conversations need to happen human-to-human, with all the messiness that entails.

### ❌ When Accountability Matters

**Financial decisions:**

AI can help you understand options, but the responsibility for major financial decisions should rest with qualified humans who can be held accountable.

**Legal matters:**

AI can explain legal concepts, but never substitute it for proper legal advice. Your lawyer has professional obligations. ChatGPT doesn't.

**Healthcare decisions:**

As we covered last week — AI can inform, but humans must decide.

### ❌ When Learning Is The Point

**Your grandchild's homework:**

Helping them understand? Useful.
Doing it for them? Harmful.

AI can explain concepts but shouldn't shortcut the struggle that builds understanding.

**Developing a skill:**

Learning photography? Don't AI-enhance every photo. Learn the craft first.
Learning to write? Don't AI-draft everything. Develop your voice first.
AI should accelerate learning, not replace it.

### ❌ When Stakes Are Too High

**Medical emergencies:** Call 000, not ChatGPT.
**Crisis situations:** Call Lifeline (13 11 14), not AI.
**Safety concerns:** Contact authorities, not algorithms.

Some situations require human response, human empathy, human action.

### ❌ When Privacy Is Critical

**Deeply personal secrets:**

Would you be comfortable if this information was stored somewhere? If not, maybe keep it between you and trusted humans.

**Family conflicts:**

Be careful sharing detailed family situations with AI. It's not bound by the same confidentiality as a therapist or trusted friend.

## 🔍 Ethical Framework: A Simple Test

Before using AI for something important, ask:

1. **Would I be comfortable if this were public?**
   (Privacy check)

2. **Who bears responsibility if something goes wrong?**
   (Accountability check)

3. **Would a human connection be more appropriate here?**
   (Relationship check)

4. **Is the goal understanding, or avoiding the work?**
   (Learning check)

5. **Are the stakes low enough for AI assistance?**
   (Importance check)

If any answer gives you pause, consider a human alternative.

## 💡 The Right Balance

AI is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment.

**Use AI for:**
- Efficiency (emails, planning, research)
- Understanding (explanations, translations)
- Starting points (drafts, ideas)
- Low-stakes decisions (dinner, activities)

**Keep human for:**
- Deep relationships
- High-stakes decisions
- Accountability situations
- Personal growth
- Emotional support

## 📧 Reader Reflection

*"I caught myself using ChatGPT to write a text to my daughter because I didn't know how to say something difficult. Then I realized — maybe the difficulty is the point. Maybe she needs to feel me struggling to find words, not reading something polished."* — Anonymous

This is wisdom. Sometimes the imperfect, human attempt communicates love more than any perfectly crafted AI response ever could.
