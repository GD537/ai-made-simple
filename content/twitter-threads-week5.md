## THREAD 14: "The prompts that changed my life"

🧵 "10 ChatGPT prompts that genuinely changed how I live my daily life (save this thread):

1/ FOR EMAIL STRESS
'Write a polite but direct email to [person] about [situation]. I want to be firm but not rude.'

I used to agonise over difficult emails. Now they take 30 seconds.

2/ FOR MEDICAL CONFUSION
'Explain this medical report in simple terms. Highlight anything I should ask my doctor about: [paste report]'

Transforms confusing jargon into understanding.

3/ FOR DECISION PARALYSIS
'I'm deciding between [option A] and [option B]. List the pros and cons of each, given that I value [priorities].'

Instant clarity when I'm stuck.

4/ FOR MEAL PLANNING
'I have [ingredients]. I'm cooking for [number] people. Suggest 3 dinner options with recipes. Keep it under 30 minutes.'

No more 'what's for dinner?' panic.

5/ FOR TRAVEL ANXIETY
'Plan a detailed day-by-day itinerary for [destination] for [number] days. I like [interests], don't like [dislikes], budget is [amount].'

Trips go from overwhelming to exciting.

6/ FOR AWKWARD SOCIAL SITUATIONS
'Help me write a [sympathy card / congratulations / apology] to [relationship] for [situation]. Make it sincere but not over the top.'

Perfect words when I can't find my own.

7/ FOR LEARNING ANYTHING
'Explain [topic] to me like I'm a smart adult who knows nothing about this subject. Use real-world examples.'

Learning curve? What learning curve?

8/ FOR DOCUMENT FEAR
'Summarise this legal/financial/technical document in plain English. What are the key points I need to understand? [paste document]'

Contracts and forms no longer scare me.

9/ FOR GIFT GIVING
'Suggest 5 thoughtful gifts for [person, age, interests]. Budget under [amount]. Explain why each would work.'

Gift giving went from stressful to fun.

10/ FOR APPOINTMENT PREP
'I'm seeing my [doctor/accountant/lawyer] about [issue]. What questions should I ask to get the most value from the appointment?'

Never leave a meeting wishing I'd asked something.

These aren't fancy. They're practical. They save time and reduce stress every single day.

## THREAD 15: "What your phone can already do"

🧵 "Your phone has AI features you're probably not using. Here's what's hiding in plain sight:

1/ 📷 PHOTO SEARCH (iOS & Android)
Open your Photos app. Type: 'beach' or 'dog' or 'birthday.'

Your phone uses AI to find matching photos — even ones you never tagged. Try 'documents' or 'receipts' — life changing.

2/ 🔍 GOOGLE LENS (Android + iPhone)
Point your camera at anything:
• A plant → species identified
• A building → history and info
• Foreign text → instant translation
• A product → where to buy it
• A math problem → solved

On Android: It's in your camera app.
On iPhone: Download Google app, tap camera icon.

3/ 🗣️ VOICE TYPING (everywhere)
Tap the microphone on your keyboard. SPEAK instead of typing.

AI transcribes with remarkable accuracy. Much faster for long messages. Try it.

4/ 📝 LIVE TEXT (iOS 15+)
Point your camera at text — a sign, a document, a business card. Tap to:
• Copy the text
• Translate it
• Look it up
• Call a phone number

Works on screenshots too.

5/ ✉️ SMART COMPOSE (Gmail)
Start typing an email in Gmail. Watch AI suggest how to finish your sentences. Tab to accept.

Saves surprising amounts of time.

6/ 📱 SIRI SUGGESTIONS (iOS)
Your phone learns your routines and suggests apps, contacts, and actions before you ask.

Notice that 'Call Mum' appears when you usually call her? That's AI.

7/ 🎵 SONG RECOGNITION (both platforms)
Hear a song you like?
• iPhone: 'Hey Siri, what song is this?'
• Android: 'OK Google, what song is this?'
• Or use the Shazam app

AI identifies songs in seconds.

You don't need to download ChatGPT to use AI. Your phone is already full of it.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 5)

### Post 35
The biggest compliment I get:

'You explain things so clearly. It doesn't feel like AI is scary anymore.'

That's the goal. Not to make AI seem amazing. Just to make it seem... accessible.

Because it is.

@AIMadeSimple

### Post 36
Hot take: The best AI users aren't young tech people.

They're retired professionals who:
✅ Provide detailed context
✅ Know what they actually want
✅ Aren't afraid to say 'try again'
✅ Have real problems to solve
✅ Value their time enough to use tools that save it

Experience wins.

### Post 37
ChatGPT prompt for anyone who struggles with technology:

'I'm [age] and not very tech-savvy. I want to [goal]. Walk me through it step by step, explaining each step like I've never done anything like this before. Tell me exactly what to tap/click.'

AI will meet you where you are. Just ask.

### Post 38
Things I wish my parents knew about AI:

1. It's free (chat.openai.com)
2. You can't break it
3. 'Try again' is a complete valid response
4. Nobody is watching your conversation
5. You're probably better at using it than you think
6. I'm happy to show you, but you don't need me

### Post 39
I asked 100 people over 60 about AI.

The #1 concern: 'I'll look stupid.'

Nobody looks stupid asking questions. The only way to look behind is to refuse to learn.

Curiosity is always smart.

### Post 40
Real conversation with my 78-year-old neighbour:

Her: 'I can't believe I waited this long to try this.'
Me: 'What changed your mind?'
Her: 'Someone finally showed me instead of telling me.'

Most AI education fails because it lectures instead of demonstrates.

Show, don't tell.
