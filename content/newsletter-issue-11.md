Welcome back! There's been a lot of doom and gloom in the news about AI replacing humans. Let's cut through the noise and talk honestly about what AI can and can't do.

## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### AI Can Now Pass Medical Exams — But Should It Be Your Doctor?

This week, researchers announced that GPT-5 scored in the 90th percentile on medical licensing exams — better than most human medical students.

**What this means:**
AI is extraordinarily good at medical knowledge. It can recall symptoms, drug interactions, and treatment protocols with near-perfect accuracy.

**What this DOESN'T mean:**
AI should not be your doctor. Here's why:

1. **Context matters.** AI doesn't know you've been stressed about your daughter's wedding for six months, which might explain your symptoms better than any textbook.

2. **Physical examination.** AI can't feel that your lymph nodes are swollen or notice that you're avoiding eye contact when discussing certain symptoms.

3. **Nuance.** Medicine is full of "usually... but sometimes." Human doctors develop intuition. AI follows probabilities.

4. **Accountability.** Who's responsible when AI makes a mistake? Your doctor takes an oath.

**The smart approach:** Use AI to understand, research, and prepare. Use humans to diagnose, decide, and care.

## 🛠️ This Week's Tutorial: Things AI Will Never Replace

Let's flip the script. Instead of worrying about what AI can do, let's appreciate what it can't.

### 1. Genuine Human Connection

AI can simulate conversation. It can say "I'm sorry you're going through that." But it doesn't feel empathy. It predicts the words that typically follow your message.

**Your advantage:** When you console a friend, celebrate with family, or comfort a grandchild — that's irreplaceable human connection.

### 2. Physical Presence and Touch

AI can't hold your hand during a difficult moment. It can't hug you when you're sad. It can't be physically present.

**This matters because:** So much of human life happens through presence — a shared meal, a walk together, sitting in comfortable silence.

### 3. Lived Experience and Wisdom

AI trained on text from the internet. You lived a life. You raised children. You navigated loss. You built relationships. You made mistakes and learned from them.

**Your wisdom is unique.** When your grandchild asks for advice, they don't want GPT-4's probability-weighted response. They want YOUR experience, YOUR values, YOUR story.

### 4. Creativity from the Soul

AI can generate art, music, and writing. But it's combining patterns it learned. It doesn't dream. It doesn't feel the urge to express something deep inside.

**True creativity:** That poem you write for your partner. The garden you design. The story only you can tell. These come from a place AI can't access.

### 5. Moral Judgment and Values

AI can tell you what people generally consider right or wrong. It can't have values. It doesn't believe in anything. It doesn't stand for anything.

**You do.** Your decisions are informed by a lifetime of values, beliefs, and principles. AI optimises for likely responses. You act on what you believe is right.

### 6. Unpredictability and Serendipity

AI is fundamentally about prediction — finding the most likely next word, response, or outcome. But some of life's best moments are unpredictable.

**Falling in love, unexpected friendships, sudden insights, the joy of a surprise** — these emerge from the beautiful chaos of being human. AI can't stumble into discoveries the way we do.

## 🔍 Tool Review: Pi by Inflection

**What is it?** A friendly AI chatbot designed specifically for conversation and emotional support. Less task-focused than ChatGPT, more conversational.

**Best for:** People who want AI that feels more like talking to a friend than a tool.

**Key difference from ChatGPT:** Pi is designed to ask follow-up questions, remember your preferences across conversations, and be genuinely engaging rather than just informative.

**Cost:** Free

**Our verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Surprisingly pleasant to talk to. Good for people who find ChatGPT too clinical. Less useful for practical tasks.

## 💡 Quick Tip

**Use AI to enhance human connections, not replace them.**

Example: Before calling your adult child, ask ChatGPT:

> "I want to catch up with my 35-year-old son. He works in marketing and has two young kids. What are some good questions I could ask to have a deeper conversation than 'how's work?'"

AI helps you prepare for human moments — it doesn't replace them.
