### By Sam Digital · May 2026

Welcome back! This week we're covering a topic many have asked about: using AI to understand and manage personal finances better. As always, AI is a tool for learning — not a replacement for professional financial advice.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**AI is NOT a financial advisor.** The information in this newsletter is educational. For personal financial decisions, always consult qualified professionals who know your complete situation.

## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### Australian Banks Add AI Features

Several major Australian banks are rolling out AI-powered features in their apps:

**What's new:**
- Spending pattern analysis ("You spent 40% more on dining this month")
- Savings goal suggestions based on your income
- Bill prediction ("Your electricity bill usually arrives around the 15th")
- Plain-English explanations of financial products

**Should you use these?**
Generally yes — these features help you understand your own money better. They're using AI to serve you, and you're not sharing anything new (your bank already has your transaction data).

## 🛠️ Tutorial: AI for Financial Understanding

### Understanding Financial Documents

**Confusing bank statement?**

> "I received this bank statement fee explanation: [paste text]. In plain English, what am I being charged for and why? Is this normal?"

**Complex super statement?**

> "My superannuation statement shows these terms: [list terms]. Explain each one simply. What should I pay attention to?"

### Budgeting Help

> "I earn approximately $[X] per fortnight after tax. My fixed costs are: rent $[X], utilities $[X], insurance $[X]. Create a simple budget that lets me save $[amount] per month while still enjoying life. I'm [age] and [situation]."

AI creates a personalized starting budget — but you decide if it works for your life.

### Understanding Investment Concepts

> "Explain what 'dollar-cost averaging' means in simple terms. Use an Australian example. What are the pros and cons?"

Don't ask AI what to invest in — ask it to help you understand the concepts.

### Retirement Planning Concepts

> "Explain the Age Pension income test in simple terms. I'm [age], [situation]. What concepts should I understand? Note: I'll verify details with Centrelink/my financial advisor."

AI explains the concepts. Professionals verify the specifics.

## 🔍 Safe AI Finance Uses vs. Risky Uses

### ✅ SAFE Uses

- **Explaining terms:** "What does 'compound interest' mean?"
- **Budgeting concepts:** "How do I create a budget?"
- **Understanding statements:** "What does this fee mean?"
- **Learning basics:** "Explain superannuation for beginners"
- **Preparing questions:** "What should I ask my financial advisor about retirement?"

### ❌ RISKY Uses

- **Specific investment advice:** "Should I buy this stock?"
- **Tax advice:** "How can I minimise my tax?" (Ask an accountant)
- **Major financial decisions:** "Should I sell my house?"
- **Predicting markets:** "Will the market go up?"
- **Personal financial planning:** "How much do I need to retire?" (Ask a planner)

## 💡 Three Prompts That Actually Help

### 1. The "Explain Like I'm New" Prompt
> "I'm [age] and never really learned about [financial topic]. Explain it to me from the beginning, using Australian examples. Assume I know nothing but I'm intelligent."

### 2. The "Question Prep" Prompt
> "I'm meeting with my [accountant/financial advisor/bank] about [topic]. What questions should I ask to get the most value from the meeting? What information should I bring?"

### 3. The "Sanity Check" Prompt
> "Someone is offering me [financial product/opportunity]. Without telling me what to do, what questions should I ask? What red flags should I watch for?"

## 📧 Reader Question

*"My bank's app now has an AI assistant. Is it safe to use?"* — Patricia, 65

Patricia, generally yes! Bank AI assistants are:

**Safe because:**
- They operate within your existing bank relationship
- They use data your bank already has
- They're regulated by Australian banking laws
- They can't access money without your authorization

**Good uses:**
- "Explain this fee"
- "Show my spending by category"
- "When did I last pay my electricity?"
- "Set up a savings goal"

**Still be cautious about:**
- Product recommendations (they're still trying to sell you things)
- Investment advice within the app
- Anything that feels pushy

The convenience is real. Just maintain healthy skepticism about sales pitches.

## 🛡️ Scam Protection Reminder

AI can help you spot financial scams:

> "I received this message claiming to be from [institution]: [paste message]. Does this look legitimate? What are the warning signs?"

Common red flags AI will help you spot:
- Urgency ("Act now or lose access!")
- Requests for passwords or PINs
- Unusual sender addresses
- Grammar/spelling errors in official communications
- Requests to use unusual payment methods

When in doubt, contact the institution directly using their official number (not from the message).
