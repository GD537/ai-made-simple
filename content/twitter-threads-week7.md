## THREAD 18: "What I tell skeptics"

🧵 "When someone says 'AI is just hype,' here's what I tell them:

1/ I don't argue about the technology. I show them one use case that matters to THEM.

'You know how you complained about writing that email to the insurance company? Here's how to do it in 30 seconds.'

One useful example > one hundred statistics.

2/ I address the real concern behind the skepticism.

Usually it's:
• 'I'm afraid of looking stupid' → You won't. AI doesn't judge.
• 'I'm too old for this' → You're not. 55+ is the fastest-growing user group.
• 'It's not for people like me' → It is now. Finally.

3/ I let them experience it, not explain it.

'Here, type this: [practical prompt]'
Wait.
'Did that help?'
Usually: 'Actually... yes.'

4/ I don't oversell.

AI isn't magic. It's a tool.
It saves time. It reduces frustration. It helps with words.
That's enough. Don't make it more than it is.

5/ I acknowledge real limitations.

'Yes, it makes mistakes sometimes. Yes, privacy is worth thinking about. Yes, don't use it for medical diagnosis.'

Honest acknowledgment builds trust. Hype destroys it.

6/ I give them permission to be curious.

'There's no rush. Try one thing. See if it helps. If not, no big deal.'

Low pressure = higher adoption.

Skepticism usually isn't about the technology. It's about confidence. Meet people with empathy, not evangelism.

## THREAD 19: "The 5-minute rule"

🧵 "My '5-minute rule' for learning AI:

1/ Give yourself 5 minutes a day.

Not to 'learn AI.' Just to try one thing.

Day 1: 'What's a good recipe with chicken?'
Day 2: 'Help me write a thank-you note'
Day 3: 'Explain climate change simply'

Small experiments compound.

2/ After 5 days, you'll have tried 5 things.

Some will be useful. Some won't.
You'll discover YOUR use cases — not the ones some tech bro on YouTube told you about.

3/ After 5 weeks, AI will feel normal.

Like Google felt normal after you used it a few times.
Like texting felt normal after the initial weirdness.
Tools become invisible when they become useful.

4/ The mistake people make:

They try to 'learn everything about AI' before starting.

You don't need to know how a car engine works to drive.
You don't need to know transformer architecture to use ChatGPT.
Just... start.

5/ Your first prompt, right now:

Go to chat.openai.com

Type: 'I've never used AI before. I'm [your age] and interested in [your interest]. What's one useful thing I could ask you?'

5 minutes. That's all.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Week 7)

### Post 47
Observation:

People who say 'AI will replace us all' usually haven't used it.

People who use it daily say 'It's a really good assistant.'

The gap between perception and reality is massive.

Try it. Then form an opinion.

### Post 48
Things AI helped me with this week:

✅ Writing a difficult email to family
✅ Understanding a medical term
✅ Planning weekend activities
✅ Creating a packing list
✅ Explaining a concept to my grandkid
✅ Finding the right words for a card

Nothing groundbreaking. Everything genuinely useful.

### Post 49
The fastest way to learn AI:

1. Open ChatGPT
2. Ask: 'What can you help me with?'
3. Read the answer
4. Try one thing
5. Repeat

No courses. No books. No YouTube tutorials.

Just... use it.

### Post 50
Prompt that helps with difficult conversations:

'I need to have a conversation with [person] about [difficult topic]. Help me think through:
1. What points should I make?
2. What objections might they have?
3. How can I phrase things sensitively?
4. What outcome am I hoping for?'

AI as conversation coach.

### Post 51
I think the biggest AI story isn't the technology.

It's the millions of people who thought technology 'wasn't for them' discovering it finally is.

Every grandparent writing their first ChatGPT prompt.
Every retiree planning a trip with AI assistance.
Every skeptic becoming a daily user.

That's the story.

### Post 52
'But I don't trust technology.'

That's fair. I'd gently suggest:

1. You don't have to trust it blindly. Verify important things.
2. You already trust calculators, GPS, and spell-check.
3. AI is another tool. Use it for what it's good at.
4. The risk of not learning outweighs the risk of trying.

Cautious adoption > complete avoidance.
