## 📰 This Week's Big Story

### The AI Job Report: What's Actually Happening

Everyone's panicking about AI taking jobs. Here's what's really going on based on 2025-2026 data:

**Jobs growing BECAUSE of AI:**
- AI trainers and prompt engineers
- Data analysts (AI creates more data to analyse)
- AI ethics and safety specialists  
- Customer experience designers
- Healthcare AI specialists

**Jobs changing (not disappearing):**
- Accountants → Now use AI to spot anomalies (same people, better tools)
- Writers → Use AI for research and drafts (still need human creativity)
- Teachers → Use AI for personalised lesson plans

**Jobs at risk:**
- Basic data entry (already automated)
- Simple translation (AI handles routine translation well)
- Basic customer service chat (chatbots handle tier 1)

**The bottom line:** AI is changing HOW we work, not WHETHER we work. The people who learn to use AI tools will thrive. That's why you're reading this newsletter. Smart move.

## 🛠️ This Week's Tutorial: AI as Your Travel Agent

Planning a trip used to mean hours of research across dozens of websites. Now it takes 5 minutes.

### The Complete Trip Planner

Open ChatGPT or Google Gemini and try this:

> "Plan a 7-day trip to New Zealand's South Island for a couple in our 60s. We love scenery, wine, and easy walks (no strenuous hiking). Budget is $5,000 AUD total excluding flights. We're from Perth, Australia. We prefer boutique hotels over big chains. We have a rental car."

Watch what happens. You'll get:
- Day-by-day itinerary
- Hotel recommendations (with price estimates)
- Restaurant suggestions
- Driving distances between stops
- Activity recommendations matched to your preferences

### Making It Better

After the first response, refine it:

> "Day 3 looks too busy. Can you make it more relaxed? Also, I forgot to mention — my wife is vegetarian."

> "Add a backup plan for Day 5 in case of rain."

> "What should I pack for this trip in March?"

> "What's the best travel insurance for over-60s going to NZ?"

Each follow-up makes the plan more personalised.

### The Restaurant Finder

Already on holiday? Try:

> "I'm in Queenstown, New Zealand. Recommend 3 restaurants for dinner tonight. One nice, one casual, one that does great seafood. Budget for two is around $100-150 NZD."

### The Packing List

> "Create a packing list for 7 days in New Zealand in March. I'm a 65-year-old woman who prefers comfortable, smart-casual clothing. Include toiletries I might forget."

### Pro Tips:
- **Be specific about YOUR preferences.** AI can't read your mind — tell it what you like.
- **Mention health considerations.** "I have knee problems" changes walk recommendations.
- **Ask about local customs.** "What should I know about tipping in New Zealand?"
- **Get it to compare options.** "Should I do Milford Sound or Doubtful Sound? Compare them for a 60+ couple."

## 🔍 Tool Review: Grammarly

**What is it?** An AI tool that checks your writing — emails, messages, documents — and suggests improvements.

**Best for:** Anyone who writes emails, letters, or documents regularly.

**How it works:** Install it on your browser or phone. It quietly checks everything you type and underlines suggestions. Click to accept or ignore.

**What it catches:**
- Spelling and grammar errors
- Unclear sentences
- Tone issues ("This sounds angry — did you mean to be?")
- Wordy phrases it can simplify

**Cost:** Free (basic spelling/grammar). $12/month for Premium (tone, clarity, rewrites).

**Our verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very useful, especially the free version. Premium is worth it if you write a lot.

**Getting started:** Go to grammarly.com and install the free browser extension.

## 💡 Quick Tip

**Ask AI to be your translator — not just for languages.**

Try: "Rewrite this medical report in plain English that a non-medical person can understand: [paste report]"

Works for legal documents, tech specs, insurance policies, government forms — anything confusing. AI is brilliant at translation between "professional jargon" and "human."
