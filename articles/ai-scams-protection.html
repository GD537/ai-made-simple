        <h1>AI Scams: 5 New Threats and How to Protect Yourself</h1>
        
        <div class="meta">By Sam Digital · February 2026</div>
        
        <p>AI is making our lives easier in many ways—but it's also creating new opportunities for scammers. The same technology that helps you write emails or plan trips can be used to deceive, manipulate, and steal.</p>
        
        <p>What makes these scams especially dangerous is how convincing they are. We're not talking about poorly-written emails from "Nigerian princes" anymore. Today's AI scams use your loved one's voice, create fake videos, and craft personalized messages that feel 100% real.</p>
        
        <p>The good news? Once you know what to look for, these scams are much easier to spot. In this guide, I'll walk you through five of the most common AI scams targeting people today—and exactly how to protect yourself from each one.</p>
        
        <h2>Scam #1: Voice Cloning ("Grandparent Scam 2.0")</h2>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        
        <p>You get a frantic phone call. It sounds <em>exactly</em> like your grandson. He's crying, says he's been in a car accident, and desperately needs $5,000 wired immediately for bail or medical bills. He begs you not to tell his parents—he's embarrassed and scared.</p>
        
        <p>Your heart races. It sounds just like him. But here's the truth: it's not him. It's AI.</p>
        
        <p>Scammers can now clone a person's voice from just a few seconds of audio—pulled from social media videos, voicemails, or even public Zoom calls. They use AI to generate a phone call that sounds identical to your loved one, complete with emotion and urgency.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
        
        <p>In 2023, a mother in Arizona received a call from what sounded like her 15-year-old daughter, crying and saying she'd been kidnapped. The voice was so convincing that the mother was ready to pay a ransom. Fortunately, her daughter called from another room—she was safe at home. The "kidnapped" voice was AI-generated.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Establish a family code word.</strong> Agree on a secret word or phrase only your family knows. If someone calls claiming to be in trouble, ask for the code word before taking action.</li>
            <li><strong>Hang up and call back directly.</strong> If someone calls in distress, hang up and call that person's actual phone number—not the number they're calling from.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify through another family member.</strong> Call the person's parent, spouse, or roommate to confirm the story.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't act on urgency.</strong> Scammers create panic to prevent you from thinking clearly. Take a breath. Real emergencies allow time to verify.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit what you share online.</strong> The less audio and video of your family members available publicly, the harder it is for scammers to clone voices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Golden rule:</strong> If someone calls asking for money—even if it sounds exactly like your loved one—verify independently before sending a penny. Real family will understand your caution.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scam #2: Deepfake Videos</h2>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        
        <p>You see a video on Facebook of a celebrity or politician endorsing a miracle weight-loss pill, investment opportunity, or "government program" to get you money. The video looks real—the person is speaking clearly, looking at the camera, even gesturing naturally.</p>
        
        <p>But it's fake. AI can now create convincing videos of anyone saying anything. These "deepfakes" are used to promote scams, spread misinformation, and trick people into buying fake products or handing over personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
        
        <p>In 2024, scammers created deepfake videos of Elon Musk promoting a cryptocurrency scam. The videos were so realistic that thousands of people lost money investing in the fake scheme. Musk had never endorsed the product—his face and voice were simply stolen and manipulated by AI.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be skeptical of celebrity endorsements.</strong> If a famous person is promoting something, check their official website or social media. Real endorsements will be mentioned there.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for glitches.</strong> Deepfakes often have subtle errors: unnatural blinking, weird mouth movements, inconsistent lighting, or audio that doesn't quite sync with the lips.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the source.</strong> Is the video on a legitimate news site or the celebrity's verified account? Or is it on a random Facebook page or sketchy website?</li>
            <li><strong>Search for the claim.</strong> Type the person's name + "scam" into Google. If it's fake, others have likely reported it.</li>
            <li><strong>Never invest based on a video alone.</strong> Do independent research. Talk to a financial advisor. Don't trust a single video, no matter how real it looks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> If it sounds too good to be true—guaranteed returns, miracle cures, exclusive deals—it probably is. Deepfakes make scams look legitimate, but the fundamentals of fraud haven't changed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scam #3: AI-Powered Phishing Emails</h2>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        
        <p>You receive an email that looks like it's from your bank, Amazon, or the IRS. The grammar is perfect. The logo looks right. The email address seems legitimate. It mentions a specific recent purchase or references your account details.</p>
        
        <p>The email says there's a problem with your account and asks you to click a link to "verify your information" or "prevent your account from being locked." You click, enter your login details, and—congratulations, you've just handed your credentials to a scammer.</p>
        
        <p>AI has made phishing emails terrifyingly good. They no longer have obvious typos or awkward phrasing. They can personalize messages using information scraped from data breaches or social media. They look and sound like real companies.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
        
        <p>In 2025, scammers used AI to send fake emails that appeared to come from popular streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. The emails claimed the user's payment had failed and their account would be suspended. Thousands of people clicked the link and entered their credit card information—giving scammers everything they needed to steal money.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Never click links in unexpected emails.</strong> If you get an email about a problem with your account, don't click the link. Instead, open your browser and go directly to the company's website.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the sender's email address carefully.</strong> Scammers use addresses that look similar to real ones, like "support@amaz0n.com" (with a zero instead of an "o").</li>
            <li><strong>Hover before you click.</strong> On a computer, hover your mouse over a link (don't click) to see where it really goes. If it looks suspicious, don't click.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication.</strong> Even if scammers get your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second verification step.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't trust urgency.</strong> Phishing emails create panic: "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!" Real companies give you time and multiple warnings.</li>
            <li><strong>When in doubt, call.</strong> Look up the company's official phone number (not the one in the email) and call to verify whether the email is real.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Banks, the IRS, and legitimate companies will NEVER ask for your password, Social Security number, or credit card details via email. If an email asks for sensitive information, it's a scam.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scam #4: Fake AI Apps with Hidden Subscriptions</h2>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        
        <p>You're scrolling through your phone's app store and see an ad for a "Free AI Photo Editor" or "AI Health Scanner" or "ChatGPT Premium (Unlocked)." The reviews look great (5 stars!), and the description promises amazing features.</p>
        
        <p>You download it. It asks for a "free trial"—you just need to enter your credit card to start. You think, "I'll cancel before the trial ends," so you sign up.</p>
        
        <p>Two weeks later, you see a $40–$100 charge on your credit card. You try to cancel, but the app makes it nearly impossible to find the cancellation button. Meanwhile, the app itself barely works—or worse, steals your personal data.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
        
        <p>In 2024, dozens of fake "AI chatbot" apps flooded the Apple and Google app stores, claiming to offer ChatGPT-like features. They charged $50–$100 per week after a 3-day trial. Many people didn't realize they'd been charged until they'd lost hundreds of dollars. The apps themselves were low-quality clones that didn't actually use real AI.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stick to official apps.</strong> For ChatGPT, download directly from OpenAI. For Google's AI, use the official Google app. Avoid third-party "enhanced" versions.</li>
            <li><strong>Read reviews carefully.</strong> Look for reviews that mention billing issues, difficulty canceling, or poor functionality. Fake reviews are often generic and overly positive.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the developer name.</strong> Scam apps are made by unknown developers. Legitimate AI apps come from recognizable companies.</li>
            <li><strong>Never enter credit card info for a "free" app.</strong> If an app is truly free, it won't ask for payment details.</li>
            <li><strong>Set calendar reminders for trials.</strong> If you do sign up for a trial, immediately set a reminder 2 days before it ends so you can cancel.</li>
            <li><strong>Review your credit card statements monthly.</strong> Catch unauthorized charges early, and dispute them with your bank.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> If an app's subscription cost isn't clearly stated upfront, or if cancellation instructions are buried in tiny text, it's likely a scam. Walk away.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scam #5: Fake Chatbot Customer Service</h2>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        
        <p>You're trying to resolve an issue with your bank, airline, or online retailer. You Google "[Company Name] customer service" and see a phone number or "live chat" link at the top of the results.</p>
        
        <p>You click it and start chatting with what seems like a helpful representative. They ask for your account number, Social Security number, or credit card details to "verify your identity." You provide the information, thinking you're talking to the real company.</p>
        
        <p>But you're not. Scammers create fake customer service websites and chatbots that look official. They use AI to have realistic conversations and trick you into handing over sensitive information.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
        
        <p>In 2025, scammers set up fake customer service chatbots for major airlines. They bought ads so their fake sites appeared at the top of Google search results. When people searched "Delta customer service," they'd land on the scam site, chat with a fake AI bot, and unknowingly give away their booking details and credit card numbers.</p>
        
        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go directly to the official website.</strong> Don't Google "customer service." Instead, go to the company's official website and use the contact info listed there.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the URL carefully.</strong> Scam sites use similar-looking URLs like "delta-support.com" instead of "delta.com." Look for the real domain.</li>
            <li><strong>Be wary of Google ads.</strong> Scammers pay for ads to appear at the top of search results. Scroll past ads to find the real company.</li>
            <li><strong>Never share sensitive info in chat.</strong> Legitimate companies rarely ask for full credit card numbers or Social Security numbers in chat. If they do, verify you're on the real site first.</li>
            <li><strong>Use official apps.</strong> Contact customer service through the company's official mobile app rather than a website.</li>
            <li><strong>If something feels off, hang up.</strong> Trust your instincts. If a customer service rep is pushy or asks for unusual information, end the conversation and call back using a verified number.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Real companies will NEVER ask for your full password or PIN. If someone claiming to be customer service asks for this, it's a scam. Hang up immediately.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>General Protection Tips: Stay Safe from All AI Scams</h2>
        
        <p>Beyond the specific scams, here are universal rules to keep yourself safe:</p>
        
        <h3>Slow Down</h3>
        <p>Scammers rely on urgency and panic. If someone is pressuring you to act immediately—whether it's a phone call, email, or text—that's a red flag. Take a breath. Verify before you act.</p>
        
        <h3>Verify Everything</h3>
        <p>Got a suspicious email? Call the company using a number from their official website. Received a call from a loved one? Hang up and call them back. Always verify through a separate, trusted channel.</p>
        
        <h3>Protect Your Information</h3>
        <p>Be stingy with personal details online. The less information scammers can find about you and your family, the harder it is for them to craft convincing scams.</p>
        
        <h3>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h3>
        <p>Use a password manager to create unique passwords for every account. If one account is breached, your other accounts stay safe.</p>
        
        <h3>Enable Two-Factor Authentication Everywhere</h3>
        <p>This adds a second layer of security. Even if scammers get your password, they can't access your account without the code sent to your phone.</p>
        
        <h3>Keep Software Updated</h3>
        <p>Update your phone, computer, and apps regularly. Updates often include security fixes that protect you from scams.</p>
        
        <h3>Educate Your Family</h3>
        <p>Talk to your spouse, kids, and grandkids about these scams. The more people who know what to look for, the safer everyone is.</p>
        
        <h3>Trust Your Gut</h3>
        <p>If something feels wrong—even if you can't pinpoint why—trust that instinct. It's better to be overly cautious than to lose money or compromise your identity.</p>
        
        <h2>What to Do If You've Been Scammed</h2>
        
        <p>If you think you've fallen for an AI scam, act quickly:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Stop communication immediately.</strong> Hang up, close the email, exit the website. Don't engage further.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact your bank or credit card company.</strong> Report fraudulent charges and freeze your accounts if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Change your passwords.</strong> Especially for accounts that might have been compromised.</li>
            <li><strong>Report the scam.</strong> File a report with the FTC at <strong>reportfraud.ftc.gov</strong> or call 1-877-382-4357.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor your accounts.</strong> Check bank statements, credit reports, and account activity for suspicious activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Warn others.</strong> Tell family and friends so they don't fall for the same scam.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Don't feel embarrassed. These scams are sophisticated, and even tech-savvy people fall for them. The important thing is to act quickly to minimize damage.</p>
        
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        
        <p>AI has created new ways for scammers to deceive and manipulate, but you're not powerless. By understanding how these scams work and following simple precautions, you can protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>
        
        <p>The key is skepticism: slow down, verify everything, and never act on urgency alone. Real emergencies allow time for verification. Real companies don't demand immediate action. Real family will understand if you double-check their identity.</p>
        
        <p>Stay curious, stay cautious, and remember: if something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts, and don't let AI scammers take advantage of you.</p>
